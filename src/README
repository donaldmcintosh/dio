---------

    dio is a device I/O analysis tool.  dio is copyrighted under 
    the MIT licence.

COMPILING:

    Compilation of dio will require a C compiler, preferably gcc.
	
    To compile dio, run the following command:

        # make dio

    (You may get a couple of warnings about redefinitions, they are nothing
    to worry about.)

    This will generate the binary.

    Then run the following command to install the binary and man page
    in /usr/local:

        # make install

    Et voila!  You have a working copy of dio.

    Don't forget to add /usr/local/bin into your PATH and /usr/local/man
    into your MANPATH.


USAGE:

    dio [ -o <output file name> ] <device name> <time interval>
    dio -l
