Here are two terminal screenshots of the sort of output that dio provides.
<P>
The top 3 lines state the device name being monitored and column headings, the next 20 are a scrolling log of formatted data output which is updated every &lt;time interval&gt; seconds. Then at the foot are maximum and total readings.<P>

This following screenshot is an example of the output from dio -l, which lists all I/O devices that can be used with dio.  Device Name is the name of the device as expected by dio.  The Class columns shows what kind of I/O device it is.  The Mapping column maps the device name to the cXtXdXsX format, where possible.
